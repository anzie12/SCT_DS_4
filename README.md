# 🚗 US Traffic Accident Analysis Dashboard

This project was created as part of my final task during a **Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology**. The goal was to analyze a large dataset of over **6 million traffic accident records** in the United States and build an interactive dashboard to uncover meaningful insights.

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: [US Accidents (2016 - 2023) – Kaggle]
- **Columns**: Location data, severity, weather, timestamps, etc.
- **Key Fields Used**:
  - `Start_Time` & `End_Time`
  - `Start_Lat` & `Start_Lng`
  - `Weather_Condition`, `Severity`, `Visibility`, `Humidity`, etc.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Extract and engineer useful time-based features (Hour, Day, Month)
- Identify accident patterns based on severity, weather, and time
- Detect geographic hotspots for accidents
- Build an interactive and filterable dashboard using Power BI

---

## 📊 Key Features

- ✅ Extracted `Hour`, `Day`, and `Month` from timestamps
- ✅ Used slicers for filtering by Month, Severity, and Weather Condition
- ✅ Created a heatmap and bubble map for **hotspot analysis**
- ✅ Used bar charts, pie charts, and card visuals to summarize patterns
- ✅ Dashboard design includes borders, legends, and layout enhancements

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Power BI** – for dashboard creation and visualization
- **Python (Pandas)** – for data cleaning and feature extraction
- **Excel** – for initial data exploration

---

## 🔍 Insights Discovered

- Most accidents occur during **rush hours** (7–9 AM & 4–6 PM)
- Many accidents happen in **fair weather**, showing high volume risk
- Hotspots are concentrated around **urban areas and major highways**
